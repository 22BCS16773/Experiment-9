# 🧠 Monthly Surprise Test (MST) - DSA Problem Set

Welcome to the **Monthly Surprise Test (MST)** repository!  
This collection of challenging **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems is specially designed to assess and enhance the learning pace of students.

We categorize each problem into:
- 🐢 **Slow Learner Path** – Step-by-step guided breakdowns.
- 🚀 **Fast Learner Path** – Direct challenges with optimization hints.
